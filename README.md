# Tesis
This project allows the children to play with activities and at the same time it helps to reduce the probability of dyslexia.
Based on a project with activities that psychologists use to detect and help children with this disability, 
our team decided to make these activities a web page to allow everyone that want to play with
these activities easy to enter and easy to use.
This project has tutorials in every game and the children has to hear it and try to do it again.
